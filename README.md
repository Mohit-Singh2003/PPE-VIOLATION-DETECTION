# PPE Violation Detection System

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) violation detection system using advanced computer vision techniques. The project was developed under the mentorship of Mrs. Sugandh Gupta, Research and Training Consultant in Artificial Intelligence at Global Infoventures Pvt. Ltd.

## Project Resources
All project-related files, datasets, and additional resources can be accessed via the following [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CMKAMtP3s1gMXNyPBqVnPxzUyceLqi7q?usp=drive_link).

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed before proceeding:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohit-Singh2003/PPE-VIOLATION-DETECTION.git
   cd PPE-VIOLATION-DETECTION
   ```

2. Download all necessary files from the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CMKAMtP3s1gMXNyPBqVnPxzUyceLqi7q?usp=drive_link) and extract them into the project directory.

3. Set up a virtual environment for the project:

   For Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   For macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. To run the application, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Key Features

### 1. Reduces Injuries
- The system identifies individuals without proper PPE, significantly lowering the risk of workplace injuries.

### 2. Enhances Safety
- By ensuring compliance with safety protocols, the system enhances overall safety capabilities within the organization.

### 3. Reduces Security Costs
- Automating PPE violation detection can help minimize security costs associated with manual monitoring and compliance checks.

### 4. Automated Notifications
- The system operates fully automated, providing timely notifications to relevant personnel regarding PPE violations.

## Technical Overview
The project utilizes the following technologies and algorithms:
- **Computer Vision**: Implemented using [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) for object detection.
- **Machine Learning**: The model was trained and deployed using [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for text extraction.
- **Python Libraries**: Key libraries used include OpenCV, PyTorch, and NumPy for data processing and model deployment.
